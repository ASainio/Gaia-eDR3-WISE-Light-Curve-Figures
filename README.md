## Matching Procedure
1. **CatWISE Catalog Match:**
   - **Search Radius**: 3 arcseconds (2015.5 Epoch)
   - **Filters**:
     ```sql
     (cc_flags NOT LIKE 'D___')
     AND (cc_flags NOT LIKE 'H___')
     AND (cc_flags NOT LIKE 'O___')
     AND (cc_flags NOT LIKE 'P___')
     AND (cc_flags NOT LIKE '_D__')
     AND (cc_flags NOT LIKE '_H__')
     AND (cc_flags NOT LIKE '_O__')
     AND (cc_flags NOT LIKE '_P__')
     AND ab_flags = '00'
     AND (
         (w1mpro < 15 AND w1snr > 30)
         OR
         (w2mpro < 15 AND w2snr > 30)
     )
     ```

## Filtering and Periodogram Analysis

### Position Filtering
- Each data point is cross-checked against the sourceâ€™s expected position based on Gaia proper motions, with generous 1 arcsecond radius.
- **Top Panels**: Raw data is plotted without additional filters.

### Sigma Clipping for Periodogram
- Sources with < 50 datapoints after filtering were discarded. 
- Data was sigma clipped for periodogram with parameters: upper = 3, lower = 3.

### Periodogram Settings
- **Period Adjustments**:
  - If the periods close to the WISE interval (~0.066 days) or its fractions were recalculated to avoid aliasing. However aliasing might still occure in some cases.
  - Aliasing fractions are indicated with gray triangles in the **Best Period** figure.
- **Period Range**:
  - Minimum period: 0.5 hours
  - Maximum period: 7 days
- **Execution**: The periodogram is run twice for improved accuracy.
- **Separate Solutions**: Each band is analyzed independently.
