1820573762770159232, Strong looking W1 period (0.0897d). ZTF r period is in Vizier (0.0986d) - our period is slightly different. ZTF g period is way off. I was interested in this because the g period is wrong and eclipser Spt is unknown.  Needs SED.
2798132572998105984, In Siyi's paper. Strong period on both bands ~0.0746d. 
1009864115437292160, Known DC:+M SDSS spectroscopic binary, however no period in literature. I was thinking if we will find later way to include the period to something.
6129977886945984896, Good W1 period ~0.2987d folds very tentatively with W2. Gaia var tag. no other info. Needs SED.
4912426397362299648, Strong W1 p 0.0299d (No W2 period). Sarah might know this from NGTS XSHOOTER proposal? So this seems to be known after all but I was not able to find the paper?
4687960621811310976, In Siyi's paper. Strong W1 period ~0.1914d. No period in W2. 
4837423353408638080, In Siyi's paper. Strong w1&w2 p.~0.1544. This has been observed at least with XSHOOTER but I do find anything in literature? Sarah does this ring any bells?
6589283094028544384, Tom's EB. IR excess.
